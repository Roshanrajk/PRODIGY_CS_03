ðŸ”’ Task Completed: Password Complexity Checker Script in Python! ðŸ”’

I'm thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a project to develop a Password Complexity Checker script in Python. This script evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria and provides live feedback to users about the password's complexity.

Key Features:

Live Feedback: Instantly assesses and displays the strength of passwords as users type.
Criteria Checking: Evaluates passwords against common complexity rules such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
Visibility Toggle: Includes an option to show or hide the password for easier verification.
This project was an excellent chance to dive into Python GUI development with Tkinter and improve my understanding of password security principles.

Excited for more challenges and opportunities to grow! ðŸš€ #Python #PasswordSecurity #Tkinter #Programming #Learning #ProdigyInfoTech
